## Rates and deadlines

Early-bird registration rate: £500. Deadline for early-bird registration: 3pm, Friday 31 October, 2025 (GMT).

Late registration rate: £550. Deadline for late registration: 3pm, Tuesday 11 November, 2025 (GMT).

There will be no registration at the conference venue. 

If you are only attending a workshop and not the rest of the conference, the rate is £100. Note: All workshops will take place on Thursday 27th November.

## Capacity

The venue for this year’s conference has a fixed capacity. Thus, all authors of conference contributions are being registered first. 

Once that is done, we will make a limited number of places available for registration for the conference on a first-come, first-served basis until we reach capacity.

## Registration links

If there is remaining capacity for the conference, these links will become active on Wednesday 8 October 2025. Once capacity is reached, these links will then be removed.

Early-bird: We have a small number of 'General Registration' places available for the full conference at: [link](https://bmva.charitysuite.com/events/prwpddoj?tickets=XaK8).

Late: It is unlikely there will be any late registration places. 

Workshop-only registration: [workshop-only link](https://bmva.charitysuite.com/events/prwpddoj?tickets=RohQ)
