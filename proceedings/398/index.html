However, when applied to remote sensing object detection (RSOD), the unique characteristics of remote sensing images, such as small objects and complex background, substantially impede the student model in effective assimilation of knowledge from its superior teacher model. In this paper, we present a novel self-distillation framework designated as Knowledge Distillation via Cross Supervising with Attention (CSAKD), in which the teacher will offer module-level mentoring and adaptive guidance to eliminate the performance discrepancy between the teacher and the student. Specifically, the teacher will have access to the intermediate features of the student, generate a new set of features, and provide additional Cross Supervising for the student. Meanwhile, we propose an Adaptive Attention Weight Modulation (AAWM) to dynamically adjust the intensity of Cross Supervising, which ensures that the student can receive targeted guidance precisely where it is most needed. In addition, we introduce an Attention-Guided Knowledge Alignment (AGKA), enabling the student to concentrate on the area that the teacher deems crucial instead of learning from the teacher’s features blindly. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we perform extensive experiments on two publicly available datasets, i.e., DIOR and NWPU VHR-10. The experimental results show that our CSAKD outperforms existing state-of-the-art knowledge distillation approaches in the realm of RSOD.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Zhan_2025_BMVC,
