However, it requires a large amount of robot demonstration data, which is laborious to collect. To address this challenge, recent methods leverage action-free video data to extract skill knowledge and generate latent plans, which contain the predicted future states and guide policy learning. In this paper, we introduce Mask2Act, a novel framework that leverages action-free videos to train a predictive multi-object tracking model to predict future masks of any task-relevant objects in the video as the latent plans. The transition of object masks enriches the latent plans with accurate task-relevant motion knowledge and eliminates distracting information. The latent plans are subsequently utilized to guide policy learning with limited training data. Experiments across 50 manipulation tasks in 2 simulated environments show that our method significantly outperforms other video pre-training methods. Furthermore, Mask2Act inherently guides the model to focus on task-relevant knowledge rather than irrelevant background and distractor information, thus demonstrating superior capability in extracting skill knowledge from cross-task videos and generalizing to new tasks and environments.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Zhang_2025_BMVC,
