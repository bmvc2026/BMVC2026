Federated learning (FL) addresses privacy concerns by enabling collaborative model training without exchanging local client data. However, managing data heterogeneity in FL is challenging due to the varying distributions and data scales at the local clients. To address these problems, we propose FSF3A, a novel federated framework with two approaches: \textbf{(i)} \textit{client localized structural loss (CLSL)}, a local training loss function that can handle varying data distributions by effectively finding a trade-off between spatial localization of local data, using modified dice loss, and the similarity between model representations to correct the local training of individual clients through our localized contrastive penalty and \textbf{(ii)} \textit{adaptive scale-aware weighted aggregation (ASWA)} method which facilitates weighted aggregation at the global model, prioritizing clients based on the data scales to ensure fairness in representation. The efficacy of FSF3A is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on UCSF PDGM, UPenn-GBM, and MSD datasets for brain tumor segmentation.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Divya_2025_BMVC,
