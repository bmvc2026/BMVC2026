However, most existing FRL models excel only in face generation and analysis, and there is a lack of models that address cross-modal tasks. To fill this gap, we pose the following question: Can we learn a universal facial representation by pre-training on web-sourced face-caption pairs for surveillance-related tasks? These tasks include both cross-modal understanding, such as face captioning and text-based face image retrieval, as well as face analysis tasks like face, attribute, expression recognition, and age estimation. In this paper, we take a step toward this objective by introducing FaceCPT, a new framework for learning facial representation using Face Caption Pre-Training. However, domain misalignment and information asymmetry between image-text pairs challenge the model's ability to achieve a meaningful interaction. To overcome this, we utilize contrastive learning along with a semantic attribute-aware loss (SAAL) to improve the semantic associations between face-caption pairs and encourage the model to focus on key semantic attributes, respectively. Experiments show that FaceCPT outperforms existing vision-language pre-training and FRL baselines, achieving state-of-the-art results in task-specific fine-tuning and improved zero-shot transferability across both single-modal and cross-modal tasks, even with low-resolution inputs.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Hasan_2025_BMVC,
