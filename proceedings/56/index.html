One learning paradigm to relieve such annotation burden is weak-shot semantic segmentation, which jointly uses full annotations for base classes and weak annotations (image-level labels) for novel classes. In this work, we follow the weak-shot learning paradigm, but use more informative point-level annotations for novel classes. Our method is built upon query-based segmentation network, which learns a query-to-mask mapping. With annotated points (keypoints), we additionally learn a keypoint-to-mask mapping. Both mappings are transferable from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, the latter mapping could help the former mapping when learning to segment novel classes. Besides, we design a confident memory bank to alleviate the ambiguity of novel classes. Extensive experiments on COCO-Stuff-10K and ADE20K datasets show the superiority of our method.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Jiang_2025_BMVC,
