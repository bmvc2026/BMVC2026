In principle, the distribution of feature maps is unlikely to the logits intuitively, whose distribution is naturally imbalanced. However, we surprisingly find that the feature distribution becomes extremely imbalanced after applying the discrete cosine transform (DCT), which shows attributes similar to logit distillation. Inspired by this, we propose Unified Frequency Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (UFD-KD), which is designed to address the negative effect of the imbalance of feature distribution. Specifically, UFD-KD applies DCT to spatial and channel dimensions respectively, attending to decouple the features based on the properties of frequency domain. For each dimension, we design a parameterized weight strategy to emphasize the minor and sparse features which used to be out of notice because of the principal features. Considering the orthogonality of the two dimensions, we assign them different weights to balance the overall feature alignment. In the validation experiments on Cifar-100, 11 teacher-student model pairs demonstrates excellent performance, achieving 3.1\% accuracy gains for ResNet50→ResNet18. Furthermore, in large-scale validation experiments on ImageNet-1K, UFD maintained competitive performance improvement (71.98\% in Swin-T→ResNet18). Additionally, we validate the task transfer capability on ADE20K, achieving 36.89\% mIoU for DeepLabv3- ResNet101→DeepLabv3-ResNet18.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Lu_2025_BMVC,
