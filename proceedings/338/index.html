Despite significant advancements in VSR over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon two key insights: (i) learning an initial coarse alignment between visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content facilitates the subsequent learning of precise visual-to-speech mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions, refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3 benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced challenging Mandarin dataset.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Wang_2025_BMVC,
