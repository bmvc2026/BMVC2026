Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach, State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts, effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner, without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Piergiovanni_2025_BMVC,
