This heterogeneity demands architectures that balance global context with fine-grained anatomical details, a challenge for standard models like U-Net and Transformer-based approaches, which either lack generalization or struggle with subtle features. Privacy constraints further restrict the use of large models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for cloud-based inference, complicating edge deployment and increasing development complexity. To address these challenges, we propose OmniSegNet, a unified, scalable encoder-decoder architecture that integrates SE-enhanced residual blocks for efficient local-global context capture and Atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) for multi-scale feature aggregation. Compound scaling of depth ($\alpha$) and width ($\beta$) supports flexible model variants ranging from 1.5M to 6M parameters, identified through latency-aware neural architecture search for real-time deployment on devices like Raspberry Pi and Arduino Nano. To generalize without task-specific tuning, we introduce OmniKD, a unified distillation framework that transfers knowledge from fine-tuned SAM models via logits, intermediate features, attention maps, relational structures, and contextual similarities, eliminating the need for handcrafted loss functions. OmniSegNet achieves up to $10\times$ parameter reduction while improving Dice scores by 10--12\% across diverse medical imaging benchmarks, including ISIC, CHAOS, and MRBrainS18, offering a scalable, efficient, and privacy-preserving solution for real-world medical segmentation.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Dasgupta_2025_BMVC,
