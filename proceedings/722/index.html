Meanwhile, detecting deepfakes, at scale, remains a very challenging task that often requires labeled training data from existing deepfake generation methods. Further, even the most accurate supervised deepfake detection methods do not generalize to deepfakes generated using new generation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised method for detecting deepfake videos by explicitly discovering intra-modal and cross-modal inconsistencies between video segments. The fundamental hypothesis behind our proposed method is that motion or identity inconsistencies are inevitable in motion-transfer deepfake videos. We provide the first mathematical and empirical evidence to support this hypothesis, hence justifying the generalizability of our method. Our proposed method outperforms prior state-of-the-art unsupervised deepfake detection methods on the challenging FakeAVCeleb dataset, and also has several additional advantages: it is scalable because it does not require pristine (real) samples for each identity during inference and therefore can apply to arbitrarily many identities; generalizable because it is trained only on real videos and therefore does not rely on a particular deepfake method; reliable because it does not rely on any likelihood estimation in high dimensions; and explainable because it can pinpoint the exact location of modality inconsistencies.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Tian_2025_BMVC,
