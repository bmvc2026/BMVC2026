While fine-tuned vision-language models show promise, they often overfit to seen classes due to the lack of supervision. Query-based methods offer strong potential by enabling object localization without explicit labels, but conventional approaches assume full supervision and thus tend to misclassify unseen classes as background in ZSS settings. To address this issue, we propose Split Matching (SM), a novel assignment strategy that decouples Hungarian matching into two components: one for seen classes in annotated regions and another for latent classes in unannotated regions (referred to as unseen candidates). Specifically, we split the queries into seen and candidate queries, enabling each to be optimized independently according to its available supervision. To discover unseen candidates, we cluster CLIP dense features to generate pseudo masks and extract region-level embeddings using CLS tokens. Matching is then conducted separately for the two groups based on both class and mask similarity. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Feature Enhancement (MFE) module that refines decoder features through residual multi-scale aggregation, improving the model’s ability to capture spatial details across resolutions. Besides, we also introduce a Random Query (RQ) strategy to further enhance the performance after training. Our method is the first to introduce decoupled Hungarian matching under the inductive ZSS setting, and achieves 0.8% and 1.1% higher hIoU on two ZSS benchmarks.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Chen_2025_BMVC,
