Effective crowd management must address congestion while ensuring pedestrian safety and comfort. Achieving this requires a reliable assessment of potential risks within crowds. While crowd density is a common indicator of congestion and can identify hazardous high-density situations, it is inadequate for evaluating risk in low- to medium-density crowds, where pedestrian movement dynamics play a more significant role. To overcome this limitation, we propose the crowd risk score (CRS), a novel quantitative metric for assessing crowd-related risk grounded in the mathematical concept of divergence from vector calculus. The proposed approach was validated using datasets derived from real-world event footage with human-annotated risk labels. 
Experimental evaluations on these datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. By computing the CRS from pedestrian data automatically obtained through deep learning-based detection and tracking, the proposed method enables end-to-end analysis of crowd-related risk directly from video input. This automation supports crowd monitoring and analysis in practical crowd management scenarios.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Nakayama_2025_BMVC,
