However, limited research explores if the merging process can occur within one model and enhance the model's robustness, which is particularly critical in the medical image domain. In the paper, we are the first to propose in-model merging (InMerge), a novel approach that enhances the model's robustness by selectively merging similar convolutional kernels in the deep layers of a single convolutional neural network (CNN) during the training process for classification. We also analytically reveal important characteristics that affect how in-model merging should be performed, serving as an insightful reference for the community. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of this technique for different CNN architectures on 4 prevalent datasets. The proposed InMerge-trained model surpasses the typically-trained model by a substantial margin.
