The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods. However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. 
Existing methods typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for difficult tasks and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain. However, our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due to constraints in their feature extraction techniques.
To overcome this, we propose **SAMWave**, a novel and interpretable approach that utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters capable of capturing complex-valued information via complex wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients, SAMWave enables SAM's encoder to capture more relevant information for dense prediction. Empirical evaluations on four difficult vision tasks demonstrate that SAMWave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods. This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for adapting segment anything models.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Yadav_2025_BMVC,
