In this work, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations that disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D geometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus substantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to avoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify the spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality. Building upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a Perturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the pre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an unauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the sensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving rendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate the generalized applicability of AegisRF across diverse downstream tasks and modalities, including multi-view image classification and voxel-based 3D localization, while maintaining high visual fidelity.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Kim_2025_BMVC,
