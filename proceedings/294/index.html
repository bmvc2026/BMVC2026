shifts and data scarcity. While previous solutions—such as ensemble methods and data
augmentation—can improve performance in isolation, they fail to generalise well across
in-distribution (IID), out-of-distribution (OOD), and low-data settings simultaneously.
We argue that this limitation stems from the suboptimal training strategies employed.
Specifically, treating all training samples uniformly—without accounting for question
difficulty or semantic structure— leaves the models vulnerable to dataset biases. Thus,
they struggle to generalise beyond the training distribution.
To address this issue, we introduce Task-Progressive Curriculum Learning (TPCL)—
a simple, model-agnostic framework that progressively trains VQA models using a curriculum built by jointly considering question type and difficulty. Specifically, TPCL first
groups questions based on their semantic type (e.g., yes/no, counting) and then orders
them using a novel Optimal Transport-based difficulty measure. Without relying on data
augmentation or explicit debiasing, TPCL improves generalisation across IID, OOD, and
low-data regimes and achieves state-of-the-art performance on VQA-CP v2, VQA-CP
v1, and VQA v2. It outperforms the most competitive robust VQA baselines by over
5% and 7% on VQA-CP v2 and v1, respectively, and boosts backbone performance
by up to 28.5%.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Akl_2025_BMVC,
