To mitigate this, various classification methods using multi-light source images captured under diverse lighting conditions have been proposed. However, such approaches struggle with two critical issues: (i) failing to clearly separate defect-like reflections from meaningful defect cues, leading to visually ambiguous representations, and (ii) incapable of capturing lighting-dependent variations in defect appearance. In this work, we propose a Dual-branch network that disentangles illumination-invariant and lighting-dependent representations via two dedicated encoders: a view-consistent encoder and a view-specific encoder. The view-consistent encoder extracts defect features that are robust to misleading reflections and invariant to changes in illumination, whereas the view-specific encoder focuses on capturing fine-grained, lighting-dependent visual cues around defect regions. This design enables the model to learn simultaneously generalized and view-adaptive representations of defects. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing multi-light source approaches in terms of average classification accuracy.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Oh_2025_BMVC,
