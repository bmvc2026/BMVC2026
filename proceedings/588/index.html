However, these methods often struggle to preserve fine-grained structural details in real-world noisy images. Inspired by the human ability for slow thinking in problem-solving, which involves breaking down tasks and addressing them step by step, this paper proposes Chain-of-Thought Semantic Denoising (CoT-SD), a novel zero-shot denoising framework that leverages multi-step self-reflective reasoning and CLIP-based semantic alignment to progressively enhance image quality. Unlike conventional single-step denoising approaches, CoT-SD formulates denoising as an iterative reasoning process in which both the encoder and the decoder progressively decompose the problem, refine their understanding, and iteratively generate cleaner images. The CLIP-guided decoder ensures that denoised outputs align with high-level image semantics, enabling deeper image understanding for reflection, thereby improving the quality of the denoised images. Experimental results demonstrate that our CoT-SD outperforms other state-of-the-art (SOTA) dataset-free denoisers. The code will be made publicly available.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Jiang_2025_BMVC,
