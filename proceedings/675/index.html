However, existing approaches often exhibit limited performance, stemming from inadequate modelling of facial dynamics, noise sensitivity, ambiguous expression semantics, and are generally specific to single-task scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a compact 3D spatio-temporal network capable of handling both expression recognition and physiological state analysis. Our network includes two custom modules: (1) Contrastive Adversarial Efficient Local Channel Attention (ConAdv-ELCA), which extracts and disentangles fine-grained local facial features, and (2) Efficient Global Channel Attention (EGCA), to capture local-global interactions. Unlike prior work, which predominantly evaluates models on similar datasets within single-task domains, our work has demonstrated the ability to generalize across different tasks that are based on facial analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that our model consistently achieves state-of-the-art or near-state-of-the-art performance on blood alcohol concentration estimation, dynamic facial expression recognition, and driver fatigue detection.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Tariq_2025_BMVC,
