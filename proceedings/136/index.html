These techniques are expected to enable applications such as content search and prediction in digital archives and digital twins. In this study, to acquire such a *4D language field*, we focus on two key challenges when applying existing methods designed for static scenes: (1) expanding the previous techniques to 4D space and (2) leveraging video-level language embeddings obtained from vision-language video foundation models. To address these challenges simultaneously, we propose *Lang4D*, a novel method that models the temporal changes of language embeddings in 3D space using video foundation models in a data-driven manner. Lang4D employs a video foundation model that inputs virtual viewpoint images, where recognition accuracy is stable, to obtain a common language embedding across all times and pixels for each video. Subsequently, it weakly supervises the learning of fluctuations in the language embeddings projected onto virtual viewpoints. In our experiments, we constructed a dataset specifically to evaluate the novel 4D language grounding and segmentation task. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method in addressing these two challenges through quantitative evaluations and ablation studies.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Masuda_2025_BMVC,
