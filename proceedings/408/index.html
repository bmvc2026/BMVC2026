Although multimodal classification approaches integrating information from several modalities outperform unimodal ones, they typically neglect that even minimal hateful content defines a video's category. Specifically, they generally treat all content uniformly, instead of emphasizing the hateful components. Additionally, existing multimodal methods cannot systematically capture essential structured information in videos, which limits the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. To address these limitations, we propose a novel classification model, the multimodal dual-stream graph neural networks. It constructs an instance graph by separating the given video into several instances to extract instance-level features. Then, a complementary weight graph assigns importance weights to these features, highlighting hateful instances. Importance weights and instance features are combined to generate video labels. Our model employs a graph-based framework to systematically model structured relationships within and across modalities. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that our model is state-of-the-art in hateful video classification and has strong explainability.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Yue_2025_BMVC,
