These shifts often unfold continually over time, posing significant challenges for test-time adaptation. A critical issue we identify in this setting is \textbf{noisy label memorization}, where the model gradually overfits to its own erroneous predictions (pseudo-labels), leading to significant performance degradation. This problem is particularly severe in \textbf{long-sequence} continual test-time adaptation, where the model must adapt continuously in non-stationary environments. To address this, we propose a novel methodology that strategically constrains weight updates to prevent noisy labels from degrading the model, resulting in significant performance improvements, particularly in long-sequence continual test-time adaptation (CoTTA) scenarios. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, ImageNet-C, CCC, and DomainNet demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art CoTTA techniques but also ensures sustained model reliability and robustness over time. Furthermore, our method exhibits greater stability across varying sample sizes and batch sizes, with reduced sensitivity to model selection—all achieved without the need for source data calibration.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Chuah_2025_BMVC,
