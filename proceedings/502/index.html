However, in real-world scenarios, defect samples are significantly rarer than normal samples, making data collection both challenging and resource-intensive. Meanwhile, the wide variability in anomaly types and the unpredictable nature of defect locations further complicate the labeling process. In this paper, we present DefectGPT, a novel approach for multi-class electrical defect detection with limited samples by leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, DefectGPT generates defect descriptions to establish a rich semantic context for subsequent reasoning and classification. To effectively utilize limited training samples and enhance classification accuracy, we introduce a novel in-context learning technique, termed hypothesis-first learning (HFL), which facilitates the DefectGPT to generate an initial hypothesis before refining its knowledge. This approach enables DefectGPT to improve defect classification progressively through self-reflection, enhancing its effectiveness and generalization with limited electrical samples. We further conduct a theoretical analysis to gain deeper insights into the underlying learning mechanism of DefectGPT. Experimental evaluations on two distinct electrical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach, highlighting its potential to reduce data dependency while maintaining high classification accuracy.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Lin_2025_BMVC,
