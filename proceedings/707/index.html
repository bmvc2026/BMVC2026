While much of the prior research has contributed to extending concept sets to enhance the semantic interpretability of the models, the spatially activated region of the concept, or localization interpretability, has been routinely neglected. Based on insights from cognitive psychology, both types of interpretability are crucial for constructing explanations that enhance human understanding and trust. This paper introduces a flexible concept locator, which serves as a simple yet effective plugin for localizing concepts in CBMs during training, and providing both semantic and localization explanations during inference. A set of dynamic masks, applicable to various backbones and gradually shrinking during the training steps, is employed to constrain the activation region of concept neurons. This allows the concepts used for category recognition to be concentratedly expressed in specific spatial areas. Experiments conducted on multiple datasets demonstrate that the proposed locator effectively locates concepts in CBMs, offering additional localization explanations at a relatively low cost.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Wan_2025_BMVC,
