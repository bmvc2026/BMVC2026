Existing works usually adopted Transformer-based architectures, such as ViT, to perform temporal motion modeling. However, these frameworks tended to overlook high-frequency components (e.g., edge textures and local motion boundaries), which compromised their ability to construct precise spatiotemporal semantic representations. To tackle this issue, we present a Frequency-Temporal feature integration framework for compressed video action recognition, which effectively combines high-frequency edge information with low-frequency global context from both temporal and frequency perspectives. At the feature extraction stage, we design a Frequency-Aware and Temporal-Spatial Embedding (FTE) module to mitigate performance degradation caused by the ViT framework’s insensitivity to high-frequency cues. During feature fusion and prediction, we introduce Frequency-Temporal Interaction Attention (FTIA), which facilitates hierarchical integration between temporal dynamics and high-frequency features, enhancing sensitivity to motion-related regions. Extensive experiments on Kinetics-400, UCF-101, and HMDB-51 demonstrate that FreqTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in the compressed domain while maintaining computational efficiency.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Zhou_2025_BMVC,
