In such scenarios, heavy occlusion weakens geometric boundaries between objects, and large differences in object scale will cause end-to-end models fail to capture both coarse and fine details accurately. Existing 3D point-based methods require costly annotations, while image-guided methods often suffer from semantic inconsistencies across views. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical image-guided 3D segmentation framework that progressively refines segmentation from instance-level to part-level.  Instance segmentation involves rendering a top-view image and projecting SAM-generated masks prompted by YOLO-World back onto the 3D point cloud. Part-level segmentation is subsequently performed by rendering multi-view images of each instance obtained from the previous stage and applying the same 2D segmentation and back-projection process at each view, followed by Bayesian updating fusion to ensure semantic consistency across views. Experiments on real-world factory data demonstrate that our method effectively handles occlusion and structural complexity, achieving consistently high per-class mIoU scores. Additional evaluations on public dataset confirm the generalization ability of our framework, highlighting its robustness, annotation efficiency, and adaptability to diverse 3D environments.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Zhu_2025_BMVC,
