Traditional Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) combined with Gaussian Processes (GPs) rely on fixed kernel functions, limiting their adaptability to diverse image regions. This paper proposes an Adaptive Kernel Dynamic BNN (AKD-BNN) framework, which enhances segmentation performance and uncertainty estimation through a dynamic kernel learning module and multi-scale feature fusion. The approach includes a dynamic kernel module that adjusts GP kernel parameters based on local image semantics, Transformer-based multi-scale feature extraction, and an uncertainty-guided loss function. Experiments on multiple medical image datasets, including brain tumor (BraTS), cardiac MRI (ACDC), and lung CT (LIDC-IDRI), demonstrate that AKD-BNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as BNN-GP and DeepLabV3+. Specifically, AKDBNN improves the Dice score from 0.90 to 0.95 on BraTS and reduces the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) by approximately 20%. The results highlight its superior segmentation consistency in complex regions, such as tumor boundaries, providing more reliable uncertainty maps for clinical applications. This study offers a robust and interpretable solution for medical image analysis, with potential extensions to other high-dimensional tasks.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{He_2025_BMVC,
