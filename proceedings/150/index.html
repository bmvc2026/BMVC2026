However, existing methods often suffer from significant performance drops due to the domain gap between training and testing images. Moreover, they typically yield only balanced, rather than optimal, performance across different weather conditions, especially when compared to models trained in a weather-specific manner. To solve this problem, we propose a novel Weather Transfer Network (WTNet), which fine-tunes all-in-one models to enhance their performance during testing. As paired degraded-clean images are unavailable during testing, WTNet transfers degraded patterns from unseen target domains to the source-domain clean images, thereby constructing domain-adaptive fine-tuning sets for effective domain adaptation. Additionally, by leveraging these fine-tuning sets, all-in-one models can be dynamically adapted to weather-specific or mixed weather models based on the degradation patterns observed during testing. Experimental results demonstrate that WTNet can significantly enhance state-of-the-art all-in-one models on benchmark real-world image deraining, desnowing, and dehazing datasets.
