At an early stage, the diagnosis of OSSN is often confused with other ocular surface diseases (OOSD) such as pterygium, pinguecula, episcleritis, papilloma, etc. Recently, AI algorithms have been explored for OSSN classification using OOSD and healthy patients as a control population. However, these algorithms either use traditional or deep models pre-trained on natural images or mild fine-tuning from some limited examples with image-level annotations, and finally perform poorly, and the results are unreliable. In this paper, we present a self-explainable deep neural network-based segmentation architecture to predict the pixel-level probability of OSSN in slit lamp images. The proposed method is more accurate and reliable than the existing methods as it eliminates the noisy variations in the images and focuses on the causal parts. The experiments in the collected data set for 163 OSSN, 200 OOSD, and 269 healthy people show the efficacy of the proposed methods in screening OSSN.<br><br><h2>Citation</h2><div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>@inproceedings{Singh_2025_BMVC,
