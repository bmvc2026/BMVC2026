The recovery of curvilinear structure is not only key to the representation of objects via ridges and other object curves but is also critical to the reconstruction from texture-poor images which lack a sufficient number of features. Prior methods advocate for the recovery of edges from multiple images which have shown very redundant in the 3D edge representation. This paper proposes 3D Curvix, a paradigm that consolidate redundant edges arising from hypotheses edge formation and multiview reconstruction. 3D Curvix organizes 3D edges by a weighted neighborhood graph which transforms parallel groups of redundant 3D edges into a one-dimensional manifold, followed by a connectivity graph construction which links 3D edges to form 3D curve segments. The result is a collection of clean, accurate 3D curves representing a sequence of dense 3D edges. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed 3D Curvix provides remarkable 3D curve segments that can be used for a variety of real-world applications.
